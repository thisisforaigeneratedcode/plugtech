Now let me create a comprehensive plan to elevate Plug Tech beyond this reference:

# Plug Tech Design Enhancement Plan
## Inspired by emox, Elevated for Your Brand

I've analyzed the emox design reference and compared it with your current Plug Tech site. Here's a comprehensive plan to borrow the best elements while creating something even more polished and unique for your computer business.

---

## 1. Header Redesign

**Current State:** Your header is functional but traditional with navigation links spread out.

**Proposed Changes:**
- **Centered search bar** - Make search more prominent like emox (larger, centered in header)
- **Add "All Categories" dropdown** - A single dropdown that reveals all categories instead of listing them all in nav
- **Streamline navigation** - Keep only: Home | Best Deals | Contact | Location
- **Add secondary category bar** - Below main header with category icons + text in horizontal scroll
- **Location indicator** - Add "Delivery to: Nairobi" with location icon like emox

---

## 2. Hero Section Transformation

**Current State:** Full-width gradient banners with text overlay - looks good but heavy.

**Proposed Changes:**
- **Split-panel hero design** - 2-3 promotional cards visible at once (like emox)
- **Product-focused banners** - Show actual product images prominently
- **Cleaner backgrounds** - Lighter gradients or solid colors with product cutouts
- **Price highlight** - Show "From KSh XX,XXX" prominently on banners
- **Keep your rotating quick deals ticker** - This is great, keep it!

---

## 3. "Explore Popular Categories" Section (NEW)

**Add a circular category grid like emox:**
- **Circular icons** with soft pastel/gradient backgrounds
- **Larger, more visual category icons** - Use product silhouettes or illustrations
- **Category name below each circle**
- **Horizontal scrollable** with smooth navigation arrows
- **Hover effect** - Subtle scale + shadow

**Categories:**
- Laptops (laptop icon/image)
- Desktops (tower icon)
- Gaming (controller/gaming rig)
- Monitors (display icon)
- All-in-One (AIO icon)
- Accessories (headphones/mouse)

---

## 4. Product Card Refinement

**Current State:** Your cards are good but a bit heavy with lots of info.

**Proposed Changes:**
- **Add star ratings** - Display 4.5/5 stars with review count like emox
- **Cleaner price display** - Show original price struck through if discounted
- **Reduce specs density** - Show only 2 key specs (RAM + Storage) on card
- **Lighter card styling** - Less border emphasis, more whitespace
- **Add "Sale" or "Hot" badge** - Small red badge for deals

---

## 5. Promotional Banners Grid (NEW)

**Add a 2-3 column promotional grid after "Latest Products":**
- **Gaming deals banner** - Gradient with gaming imagery
- **Laptop specials** - Show popular laptop with price
- **Trade-in promotion** - "Trade your old PC" banner
- **Office setup bundle** - Desktop + monitor combo deal

**Design:**
- Rounded corners
- Subtle hover animations
- Call-to-action button overlay

---

## 6. "Brand Partners" Section (NEW)

---

- **Keep CnBCode credit** - Already in place

---

## 9. Micro-Interactions & Polish

- **Skeleton loading everywhere** - Already have this, extend to more sections
- **Scroll-triggered animations** - Fade in sections as user scrolls
- **Button hover states** - Subtle scale + shadow lift

---

## 10. Color & Typography Refinements
